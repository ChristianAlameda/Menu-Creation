# Computer Science Project Title

## Overview

The main objective of the system is to obtain and give information about what type of meal/ingredient the user wants. The user also can choose between what type of meals/ingredients they want. 
We will have a menu that is accessible to the user, allowing the user to see all the diverse types of meals and what each meal includes. The user will be able to input a meal or change a meal that has been given so that the ingredients or price may be changed.

## Introduction

The idea came about when working with data structures in college and I thought it would be cool to make a program that uses all the data structures with all their functionality and then after that I would try and find the speed. Apart from that, we thought it might be cool if we could make resumes for local mom and pop restaurant restaurants, An easy way to format creat their resumes might help with the task of owning a restaurant. 
## Features

List the key features and functionalities of your project.

- Includes: Lists, Linked Lists, Sorted Linked Lists, and Hash Tables
- The user has the ability to test each data structure playing with adding, searching, removing, and printing their menu that they see 
- Lastly, there is a race of the data structures that the user can watch and see which one is faster at searching. 

## Technologies Used

Provide a list of technologies, programming languages, and frameworks used in your project.

- I used CSV (comma separated value) files to hold the data
- I use the os and time library to create in order to test the speed as well as time to measure the speed of how long it takes to search. 

## Installation

Include instructions on how to install and set up your project locally.

```bash
# Example installation steps
git clone https://github.com/ChristianAlameda/Menu-Creation
cd Menu-Creation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
## Usage
- For newer computer science students to see just how much a difference data structures can have
- Fun to race data structures and see which wins.
