The main objective of the system is to obtain and give information about what type of meal/ingredient the user wants. The user also can choose between what type of meals/ingredients they want. 
We will have a menu that is accessible to the user, allowing the user to see all the diverse types of meals and what each meal includes. The user will be able to input a meal or change a meal that has been given so that the ingredients or price may be changed. 

## HI
This was a group project with me(Christian Alameda), Yahir Lopez, and Yumong Lee
Yumong left half way through so that is why his name is less mentioned the further we go along

## Hello
We wanted to make a menu creation for family restaurants so they could easily alter there menus 
and easily print them out as needed.
Once we finished with lists, we made it faster using hashing 

## Taco
I hope you all enjoy playing with this program, and please let me know about any problems you may find
Thank you
