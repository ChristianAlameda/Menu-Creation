This was a group project with me(Christian Alameda), Yahir Lopez, and Yumong Lee
Yumong left half way through so that is why his name is less mentioned the further we go along

We wanted to make a menu creation for family restaurants so they could easily alter there menus 
and easily print them out as needed.
Once we finished with lists, we made it faster using hashing 

I hope you all enjoy playing with this program, and please let me know about any problems you may find
Thank you
